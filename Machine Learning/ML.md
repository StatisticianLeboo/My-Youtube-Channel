# My Machine Learning Journey

This repository documents my learning journey in machine learning, with content shared on YouTube and additional resources I've explored.

## Scope

Machine learning consists of various paradigms, and this repository focuses on three key areas:

- **Supervised Learning** â€“ Learning from labeled data to make predictions and classifications
- **Unsupervised Learning** â€“ Discovering patterns and structures in unlabeled data
- **Reinforcement Learning** â€“ Training agents to make decisions by maximizing rewards in dynamic environments

## Tools & Languages

- **Python** â€“ For data manipulation, modeling, and visualization.
- **R** â€“ For statistical analysis and machine learning techniques.

## Repository Contents

This repository includes:
- ðŸ“‚ **Sample datasets** â€“ Real-world and synthetic data for practice
- ðŸ“œ **Code implementations** â€“ Practical examples for different ML models
- ðŸ“š **Reading materials** â€“ Useful resources, articles, and notes
