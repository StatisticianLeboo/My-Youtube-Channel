# Supervised Machine Learning Practice

This repository is dedicated to my practice and exploration of supervised machine learning techniques.

## What is Supervised Learning?

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where a model is trained using labeled data. The algorithm learns the relationship between input features and the corresponding output labels, allowing it to make predictions on new, unseen data. Supervised learning is commonly used for classification and regression tasks.

## Models Covered/to be covered

- **Linear Regression**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Decision Trees**
- **Random Forest**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost)**
- **Neural Networks (Basic Feedforward, CNN, RNN)**
- **Naive Bayes**

Each model is explored with sample datasets, codes using R and Python, performance evaluations, and visualization of results.
